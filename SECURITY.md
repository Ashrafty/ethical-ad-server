# Security Policy

This is adapted from the [security policy](https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/security.html) for Read the Docs itself.


## Supported Versions

Currently, we are not supporting private installations of the ethical ad server.
For our own releases, we always release from [tags](https://github.com/readthedocs/ethical-ad-server/tags).
The latest tag is (most likely) what is running live on the site.


## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe youâ€™ve discovered a security issue on the ethical ad server,
please contact us at security@readthedocs.org.
We request that you please not publicly disclose the issue until it has been addressed by us.

You can expect:

- We will respond acknowledging your email typically within one business day.
- We will follow up if and when we have confirmed the issue with a timetable for the fix.
- We will notify you when the issue is fixed.
