TODO: Find a way to make this non-EA specific,
but for now I think we can't avoid it because of linking to content on our marketing pages.

</p>

<p>
  Thanks for being one of our publishers on the EthicalAds network.
  We do payouts by the 15th of the month,
  as noted in our <a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/publisher-policy/">Publisher Policy</a>.
  If you haven't had a chance to look it over, please do,
  as it sets expectations around ad placements, payments, and more.
</p>

{% if due_report.total.ctr < .07 %} {# Only warn is a good deal below .1 #}
<p>
  We generally expect all our publishers to maintain a CTR (click though rate) around or above .1%.
  Your CTR is currently <strong>{{ due_report.total.ctr|floatformat:3 }}%</strong>,
  which is below our current minimum.
  We have a few suggestions in our <a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/publisher-guide/">Publisher Guide</a> around improving placements,
  but the main thing is just having the ad be on the screen in a visible place for long enough for users to see and click on it.
</p>
{% endif %}

<p>
We are now processing payments for <strong>{{ today|date:"F" }} {{ today|date:"Y" }}</strong>,
and you made a total of <strong>${{ due_report.total.revenue_share|floatformat:2 }}</strong> for ads displayed between <strong>{{ start_date|date:"F j" }}-{{ end_date|date:"F j" }}</strong>.
You can find the full report for this billing cycle on our <a href="{{ due_report_url }}">revenue report</a>.
</p>

{% if first %}
<p>
We need a few pieces of information from you in order to process a payment:
</p>

<p>
  <ul>
    <li>The name of the person or organization that will be receiving the payment</li>
    <li>The address, including country, for the person or organization</li>
    <li>Fill out the payment information in the <a href="{{ settings_url }}">publisher settings</a></li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Please reply to this email with the name & address of the person or organization receiving this payment.</strong>
  Once we have this information, we will process the payment.
  These will show up in the <a href="{{ payouts_url }}">payouts dashboard</a>,
  once they have been started.
</p>
{% else %}
<p>
  Since we have already processed a payout for you,
  we should have all the information needed start the payout.
  You can always update your payout settings in the <a href="{{ settings_url }}">publisher settings</a>.
  Payouts will show up in the <a href="{{ payouts_url }}">payouts dashboard</a> for your records once processed.
</p>
{% endif %}

<p>
  Thanks again for being part of the EthicalAds network.
  If you are enjoying EthicalAds,
  we'd love to ask you to recommend us to a friend.
  We are looking to grow our publisher network,
  and are always on the look out for other developer-focused publishers.
</p>

<p>
  Cheers,<br>
  EthicalAds Team
