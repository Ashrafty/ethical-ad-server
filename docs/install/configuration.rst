Configuration
=============

The server is intended to be configured by setting **environment variables**.
Most web hosts that will run a Dockerized application,
such as Heroku, AWS Elastic Beanstalk, or Azure App Service,
have ways to set environment variables in line with the `Twelve Factor App`_.

Environment variables
---------------------

There are a few required environment variables and the server will not start without them:

* :ref:`install/configuration:DATABASE_URL`
* :ref:`install/configuration:SECRET_KEY`


ADSERVER_ADMIN_URL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Set to a unique and secret path to enable the Django admin at that path.
For example, if this is set to ``admin-path``
then the Django admin will be available at the URL ``http://adserver.example.com/admin-path/``.
By default, the Django admin is disabled.


ADSERVER_HTTPS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Set to ``True`` to enforce some security precautions that are recommended when run over HTTPS:

* The session and CSRF cookie are marked "secure" (not transmitted over insecure HTTP)
* HSTS is enabled


ALLOWED_HOSTS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This setting will adjust Django's ``ALLOWED_HOSTS`` setting.
By default in production this is set to ``['*']`` which will allow any host header.
For improved security, set this to the host you are using (eg. ``['adserver.example.com']``).


DATABASE_URL
~~~~~~~~~~~~

This will set the address of the database used by the ad server.
While any database supported by Django will work, PostgreSQL is preferred
(eg. ``psql://username:password@127.0.0.1:5432/database``)


DEBUG
~~~~~

This setting will turn on Django's ``DEBUG`` mode.
It should be off in production (which is the default).
Set to ``True`` to enable it.


INTERNAL_IPS
~~~~~~~~~~~~

This setting will adjust Django's ``INTERNAL_IPS`` setting.
This setting has a few additional meanings for the ad server including:

* All ad impressions and clicks from ``INTERNAL_IPS`` are ignored for reporting purposes


SECRET_KEY
~~~~~~~~~~

This required setting will be your Django ``SECRET_KEY``.
Set this to something random like 50 random alphanumeric characters and keep it a secret.
The server will refuse to start without this.

There are a few implications to changing this setting in a production deployment including:

* All sessions will be invalidated (everyone gets logged out)
* Password reset tokens are invalidated


Overriding settings entirely
----------------------------

While most options can be set by tuning environment variables,
for a complex setup, you might consider completely overriding the settings.

To completely override the settings, create a new file ``config/settings/mysettings.py``
which should extend from ``config/settings/base.py``
and then you'll need to set the environment variable ``DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE``
to ``config.settings.mysettings``
(note that the path is separated by dots and there is no file extension).

Once this is done, other :ref:`install/configuration:Environment variables` will be configured
in your new ``mysettings.py`` rather than with environment variables.
