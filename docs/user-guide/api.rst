Authentication
--------------

We require authentication on some requests,
but JSONP requests don't require them.
Authentication works in one of two ways:

 * For requests made in your web browser,
   your authenticated session will be used
 * For all other requests, you need to use the ``Authorization`` HTTP header::

       Authorization: Token 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000

   Where the value of the header is the string "Token"
   followed by a space and your 40 character API key.

.. note::

    Creating a token for a user can be done in the :doc:`administration interface </user-guide/administration>`
    section under :guilabel:`Username Dropdown > API Token`.
